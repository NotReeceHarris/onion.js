# ðŸ§… TorV3

This npm package generates Tor v3 addresses along with their corresponding public and private keys. Tor v3 addresses are a type of onion address used by the Tor network for enhanced anonymity and security. By using this package, users can easily generate unique Tor v3 addresses that are difficult to trace back to their source, providing an additional layer of privacy to their online activities. The generated keys are matched to ensure the integrity and security of the address.

## Installation

Installing torv3 is a straightforward process. First, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version `12.x` or higher and a node package manager (such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) installed on your system.

To install torv3, open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

```
npm i -g torv3@latest
```

This command will install torv3 globally on your system, making it available to use from any directory.

After installation, you can confirm that torv3 is working correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```
torv3 --version
```

This should display the version number of torv3 that you just installed.
